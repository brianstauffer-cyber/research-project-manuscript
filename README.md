## Project Overview
This project explores how **machine learning** can detect **GPS spoofing attacks** in autonomous vehicles (AVs), a growing threat to navigation safety.  

I evaluated **LSTM**, **CNN**, and **Transformer** deep learning models, and found that **hybrid approaches** provide the best defense against spoofing attempts.

## Key Highlights
- **LSTM** → Excellent at spotting sequential GPS anomalies (98.5% accuracy).  
- **CNN** → Strong at spatial feature extraction (up to 99% accuracy).  
- **Transformers** → Handle complex, long-range interactions (>95% accuracy).  
- **Hybrid Models** → Combining LSTM + CNN + Transformer improves resilience.
